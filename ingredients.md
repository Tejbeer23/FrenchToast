What are the Ingredients for French Toast?
1. Bread
2. Eggs
3. Milk – you can use your favorite milk or milk alternative in this recipe if you want to make your French toast without milk.
4. Salt – add a pinch of salt to balance the flavors and sweetness
5. Sweetener – you definitely have options for the sweetener to use based on your personal preferences.
6. Flavorings – I personally love to include vanilla extract and ground cinnamon for a classic French toast flavor. You can omit the cinnamon, if you prefer or add more for a more pronounced cinnamon French Toast.
7. Butter – melted on the griddle for cooking and then add a pat for serving, if desired.
8. Maple syrup – real maple syrup for the perfect French toast!
    You can also use a fruit syrup like blackberry syrup if you prefer.
